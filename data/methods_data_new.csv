10201583,enrollment and randomization,"In this approach, the two treatment groups were balanced simultaneously over five predetermined stratification variables: age (25-54, 55-64, 65-75), center (14 sites), gender (male, female), race (black, white, Asian, other), and diagnosis (primary, pigmentary, and pseudoexfoliative forms of open-angle glaucoma).",['12a']
10201583,enrollment and randomization,"Given the large number of stratum cells (792) relative to the desired sample size (600), a simple stratified randomization approach would have yielded many empty and sparse cells; therefore, the minimization approach was selected to balance treatment assignments over the marginal totals of each stratum separately.",['10']

10201583,treatment sequence,"During the initial study period (until July 1996, when failure criteria were altered; see below), these criteria included failure to meet a target IOP that was established at the time of randomization or evidence of progressive visual field loss or both.",['0']
10201583,treatment sequence,"Target IOP was established based on the patient's reference IOP (i.e., the mean of six separate IOP measurements taken in the course of the two baseline visits) and their reference visual field score (i.e., the mean of visual field scores from at least two Humphrey 24 -2 visual fields taken during the two baseline visits).",['6a']
10201583,treatment sequence,The formula for target IOP calculation is as follows: target IOP (1-[reference IOP visual field score]/100) reference IOP.,['0']

10201583,treatment sequence,"Visual field-related intervention failure required evidence of progressive visual field loss, which was declared if the overall score (see below for a description of score calculation) was increased by 3.0 or more units above the reference visual field score on three consecutive tests performed at separate clinic visits.",['6a']
10201583,treatment sequence,"Because of concern that the use of the target IOP alone to arbitrate intervention failure might result in overly aggressive advancement in the treatment sequence, the criterion for IOP failure was modified after July 1996.",['3b']
10201583,treatment sequence,The revision permitted greater tolerance for measured IOP relative to the target IOP depending on the extent of field loss in the central visual field region.,['0']
10201583,treatment sequence,"Evidence of central field loss requires the strictest conformance to target, in that a measured IOP on a follow-up visit that is more than 15% over the target triggers consideration of intervention failure, whereas field loss that spares the central four points but involves the paracentral region allows more tolerance (20% or 25% above the target IOP depending on the extent of paracentral field loss) for a measured IOP at a follow-up visit relative to the target IOP.",['0']
10201583,primary and secondary study outcome,"One measure of visual function, sustained progression in visual field loss, constitutes the study's primary outcome variable.",['6a']

10227413,serial eligibility screening rule,We designed the rules to protect the screening program against severe regression toward the mean; the screening rule at the initial contact had moderate specificity (most people who would pass the screen would be eligible for the trial) but low sensitivity (many people excluded would have been eligible had they been invited back to further screening visits).,['0']

10227413,conditional rule,"For SBP, we considered 150, 155, and 160 as the lower cutpoints; some rules added the constraint (SBP 1 SBP 2 )/ 160, whereas others specified that max(SBP 1 , SBP 2 ) 160.",['0']
10227413,conditional rule,All screening programs set the upper limit of SBP at 220 for each of the screening rules.,['0']

10227413,conditional rule,The observation that the pilot study randomized 93% of those who came to screening visit 3 suggested that a judicious choice of screening rules could allow development of a screening program with only two screening visits.,['0']

10227413,conditional rule,"For example, because the cutoff for the initial contact visit was 160 SBP 0 , the only rules for which we had data were those with lower bounds at least 160; we could not consider rules with a cutoff at the initial contact visit less than 160.",['0']
